## No. of openings:

I've used tableau visualization software to explore the nyc open jobs dataset. I figured out that 'Dept of Health/Mental Hygiene' agency
has about 2800 open positions and is hence it tops the agencies with more number of openings list.

## High salary department:

In case of salaries, I discovered that departments offered salary based on two categories i.e, hourly and annual. So on an hourly pay, the 
'Asset Mgmt / Mech maintenance' division is the only division that pays around $394 per hour for some of its job positions. 
By plotting the data distributions between various 'divsion/work units' and 'salary range to' attributes, It was evident that
'STD Medical Services' department offers a very high salary of about $218,799 for some positions on an annual basis under them. 

## Low salary department:

Similarly, When I tried to experiment the same with low salary departments, There were many 'divisions/work units' that offered thin salaries.
And out of them the lowest, which is $9 were offered by 14 different 'divisions/work units' on an hourly basis. With regards to annual pay
the 'Operations' division pays the lowest of about $26,536 per annum. I suggest you to check out the visualization images to 
open them in a separate tab to get more insights from them. 

The list of low paying divisions on an hourly basis are as follows,

1. A/c Collections
2. A/c Employee services
3. A/c Payment management support
4. Administration
5. Audit-mod, Dt An & Rprtng
6. Banking Relations
7. Collections Law
8. Ctywd Payments & Rcvbles-ops
9. D/c of Tax audit & Enforcements
10. Property field REUC/Remission
11. Property quality assurance
12. Sheriff Administration
