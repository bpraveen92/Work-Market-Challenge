## No. of openings:

I've used tableau visualization software to explore the nyc open jobs dataset. I figured out that 'Dept of Health/Mental Hygiene' agency
has about 2800 open positions and is hence it tops the agencies with more number of openings list.

## High salary department:

In case of salaries, I discovered that departments offered salary based on two categories i.e, hourly and annual. So on an hourly pay, the 
'Asset Mgmt / Mech maintenance' division is the only division that pays around $394 per hour for some of its job positions. 
By plotting the data distributions between various 'divsion/work units' and 'salary range to' attributes, It was evident that
'STD Medical Services' department offers a very high salary of about $218,799 for some positions on an annual basis under them. 

## Low salary department:

Similarly, When I tried to experiment the same with low salary departments, There were many 'divisions/work units' that offered thin salaries.
And out of them the lowest, which is $9 were offered by 14 different 'divisions/work units' on an hourly basis. With regards to annual pay
the 'Operations' division pays the lowest of about $26,536 per annum. I suggest you to check out the visualization images to 
open them in a separate tab to get more insights from them. 

The list of low paying divisions on an hourly basis are as follows,

1. A/c Collections
2. A/c Employee services
3. A/c Payment management support
4. Administration
5. Audit-mod, Dt An & Rprtng
6. Banking Relations
7. Collections Law
8. Ctywd Payments & Rcvbles-ops
9. D/c of Tax audit & Enforcements
10. Property field REUC/Remission
11. Property quality assurance
12. Sheriff Administration
13. Systems Modernization-BTS
14. Systems Modernization-PTS

## Which jobs do you think are the hardest to fill ?

In my opinion, upon looking at the data and its attributes, I feel that jobs with less number of openings that require candidates to have a minimal qualification of a higher degree such as Master's or Phd and those that also require candidates to have a greater years of experience in their preferred skills are most likely to be tough or hard to fill in.

This is due to the fact that candidates who actually apply for these positions are supposedly well qualified in a multitude of aspects. They seem to have a variety of skills and they also bring in plenty of real time work experience along with them. This makes it really hard for the recruiters to filter out candidates at first place. Secondly, as the salary range begins to go beyond average, the recruiters tend to get into a confused state and that's because they face huge difficulty in ranking the individual's who've applied for those positions. It's basically tough time for the recruiters to find the right fit for those kind of jobs.
