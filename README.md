# Work-Market-Challenge

## Counting vitae

File descriptions:

1. The resume.txt file contains my resume in plain text format.
2. The resume-parse.ipynb file has the python code used to build the visual display of word frequencies. 
3. word_count.png is the name of the bar chart image. Try opening the image in a new tab to view it with extra zoom. 

Note: I've hard coded to display the top 30 word frequencies. You could change this here (c = Counter(words).most_common(x)) where 
you could plug in values in place of 'x'.
